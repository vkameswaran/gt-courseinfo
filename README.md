# gt-courseinfo

This is a python script that will take a list of Georgia Tech CRNs, and print out the name and instructional method of each class. I built this in July 2020, to make it easier to track my classes, since it was difficult to find a summary of this information in Georgia Tech's web portal.

## Usage
`$ python3 courseinfo.py 91533`  
Output: ```MATH 2550  	L	Fully at a Distance (BOR) Instructional Method```
